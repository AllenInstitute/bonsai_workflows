Bonsai issues:

- can't remove or reorder connections by right-clicking
- swapping out operators -- this would be super helpful
- changing Subject types without deleting -- again, very helpful
- what do the different subjects do? need more intuitive explanation for this
- "in range" expression? would be easier than using GreaterThan + LessThan + Zip
