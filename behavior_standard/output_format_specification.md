## Introduction 

### What is Bonsai?

[Bonsai](https://bonsai-rx.org) is an open-source visual programming language for controlling systems neuroscience experiments. The logic of each experiment is specified by a Bonsai “workflow” file, which defines how diverse input and output signals are coordinated in time. The [BonVision](https://bonvision.github.io/) package includes workflow nodes for generating visual stimuli and presenting them with high temporal fidelity. Additional packages provide interfaces to NI hardware, Arduinos, and other data acquisition devices. This makes it feasible to replicate the functionality of Camstim, the MindScope Program's PsychoPy-based behavioral control software, using existing Bonsai packages.
